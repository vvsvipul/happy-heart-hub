# 🌟 Welcome to **Happy Heart Hub** ❤️🚀  

The **Happy Heart Hub** is a groundbreaking project that puts machine learning (ML) and generative AI models through their paces under high-load conditions! We’re on a mission to find out which orchestration tool—**Kubernetes** or **Docker Swarm**—shines brightest when managing real-time, resource-intensive health applications. 🩺💻  

## 🌈 **What Makes This Project Special?**  
Imagine an AI system predicting cardiovascular risks 💔 while dynamically scaling to meet a flood of real-time data requests. That’s what we’re doing here—deploying cutting-edge ML and generative AI models and testing them to their limits.  

We’re not just running tests; we’re paving the way for **scalable, high-availability AI solutions** in healthcare! 🏥✨

### **2. Orchestration Tools 🤖**  
- **Kubernetes** and **Docker Swarm** are used to deploy, scale, and manage the models in real time.  
- The focus is on high availability and fault tolerance.  

### **3. Performance Testing 🧪**  
- **JMeter** simulates diverse real-world load scenarios:  
  - Light, medium, and heavy traffic 🚦  
  - Sudden spikes in request rates 🌊  
  - Long-term steady-state operations 🕒  

### **4. Comparative Analysis ⚔️**  
- Metrics like latency, throughput, and resource utilization are collected for **Kubernetes vs. Docker Swarm**.  
- Detailed insights help determine the best fit for healthcare AI applications.
