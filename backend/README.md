# HappyHeartHub

## Overview
This web application aims to predict the likelihood of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) based on various health parameters using advanced data mining techniques. Users can input their demographic information, lifestyle habits, and medical indicators to receive personalized predictions about their cardiovascular health. The application integrates a predictive model developed using the *K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm* with user-friendly web interfaces to provide convenient access to health predictions.

## Features
* üîÆ **Health Prediction:** Users can input their health parameters and receive predictions about their risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.
* üîê **User Registration and Login:** Secure user registration and authentication mechanisms are implemented to protect user data and provide personalized experiences.
* üõ†Ô∏è **Technologies:** The application is built using *Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Docker*, and other technologies for scalability, reliability, and maintainability.
* üèóÔ∏è **Modular Architecture:** The application follows the *Model-View-Controller (MVC)* architectural pattern for organizing code into separate components, ensuring scalability and separation of concerns.
* ü§ñ **Integration with Machine Learning Model:** The *KNN* predictive model is integrated into the backend to provide accurate predictions based on user input.
